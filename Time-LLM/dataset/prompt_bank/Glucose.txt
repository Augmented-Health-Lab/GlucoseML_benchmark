Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data provide high-frequency measurements of blood glucose levels and are widely used in diabetes management and research. This dataset consists of multivariate time-series glucose data collected from multiple individuals, with measurements sampled every 5 minutes. Each data point represents an interstitial glucose value recorded by a wearable sensor. The time series lengths vary across individuals due to different monitoring durations. The goal of this task is long-term time-series forecasting, where future glucose values are predicted based on historical observations. The dataset is split chronologically into training, validation, and test sets for each individual to prevent information leakage across time.
